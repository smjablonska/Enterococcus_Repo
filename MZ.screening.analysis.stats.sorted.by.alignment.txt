We specifically looked for a synergistic interaction between phages and antibiotics that affected the bacterial growth over 18 hours of co-cultivation in liquid medium. The successful combinations of phage and antibiotic synergy were identified based on the comparison of percentage reduction of bacterial growth in the presence of both antibiotic and phage versus either phage or antibiotic only.

In an effort to provide a comprehensive view of the newly discovered female urinary microbiota (FUM), we have established an Enhanced Quantitative Urine Culture (EQUC) protocol.

The reference database encompasses 196 species, including major aerobes, facultative anaerobes, and some anaerobes.

In an effort to provide a comprehensive view of the newly discovered female urinary microbiota (FUM), we have established an Enhanced Quantitative Urine Culture (EQUC) protocol. EQUC isolates bacteria from 75-90% of urine samples deemed 'no growth' by the standard clinical microbiology urine culture method. We have begun to sequence and annotate the genomes of these isolated bacteria.
