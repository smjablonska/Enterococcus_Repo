# Enterococcus Repo
Compbio - Enterococcus Project Repo

This project was compiled by Sandra Jablonska, Gracec Chilton, and Ken Sandoval as part of Dr. Wheeler's COMP 383/483 Computational Biology class.

All are part of the Bioinformatics Program at Loyola University Chicago.


##**Overview:**


##**Goals & Non-Goals:**

Build a quality pipeline that prepares a phylogenetic tree from taxonomic names or metagenomic raw reads
Document the process with step-by-step instructions
Will only be using either taxonomic names or metagenomic FASTA files as input data sets to perform pipeline tasks
Will only be outputting phylogenetic trees (with the branch lengths) for the final product
